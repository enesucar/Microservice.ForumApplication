The problem is, the menu buttons are not horizontal, but are oblique and partially overlapping each other.

I tried something like this with ImageButton in RelativeLayout:","Dec 29, 2023 @ 13:52:40.957","bb47b662-38a6-ee11-828e-202b20d3c2e1",1,"Android unusual Image Buttons","a9e641b1-cea5-ee11-828e-202b20d3c2e1"

I am trying to write an R shiny app that, given a directory of image files, takes user input and decides which images to display on the page. The number of images may vary depending on the user's input. I have chosen to reach this goal using a ""lookup table"", a CSV file that contains the name of all the image file paths as one column and a filtering column that matches the user's input.

Serialization is done into a boost::archive::text_oarchive and the separator is set to space. So after deserialization only the first part of the string got read from the archive e.g. I wrote ""Hello World"" to the archive but only got ""Hello"" after deserialization. For std::string boost adds a length field before the text. This is not the case for the custom string.","Dec 29, 2023 @ 01:24:24.005","b52e0bda-cfa5-ee11-828e-202b20d3c2e1",1,"Boost serialize for std::basic_string with custom allocator","7f22bc17-cfa5-ee11-828e-202b20d3c2e1"
